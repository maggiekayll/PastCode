Hi there!

My name is Maggie Kayll. In May 2023, I graduated from the College of William & Mary with a BA in Economics and a minor in Data Science. I currently work as a Technical Solutions Engineer at Epic Systems.

Here, I'll be posting some coding developments I've made mainly throughout my data science courses. I have an interest in Machine Learning, Classification models, and some basic regression models. Most (if not all) of the code I'll be pasting here is written in Python. 

Feel free to use any of the code here as you please.

Maggie
